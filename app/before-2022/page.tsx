            I grew up in Shanghai and majored in Economics at Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting
            and Finance. It was a bit of a whirlwind: I had great times with close friends, but the
            pandemic pulled everyone apart and the academic journey felt disjointed. Still, I
            completed a thesis I’m proud of on how government policies influence companies’ ability
            to innovate. The project took almost two years of data collection and analysis, and it
            taught me the basics of academic research, which was surprisingly fun and rewarding.
